Replication 1:  get new set of phalanxes at the start of each CV,,,,,,,
Replication 2: get new phalanx at the start of each 16 replications of 10-fold CV,,,,,,,
"CV A: get phalanx before CV, using same folds CVs A, B, C",,,,,,,
"CV B:Â build EPX inside CV loop, same fold as CVs A, B, C",,,,,,,
"CV C: Random Forest models, same fold as CVs A, B, C",,,,,,,
